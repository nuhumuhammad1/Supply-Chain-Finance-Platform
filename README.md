## Overview

This decentralized supply chain finance platform leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient ecosystem for managing trade finance, invoice factoring, credit assessment, and risk mitigation across global supply chains. By connecting buyers, suppliers, financiers, and insurers through smart contracts, we eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and accelerate the flow of capital throughout the supply chain.

### Mission
To democratize access to working capital across global supply chains, enabling businesses of all sizes to optimize cash flow, reduce financing costs, and mitigate payment risks through blockchain-powered financial solutions.

## Architecture

The platform is built on four integrated smart contract systems that work together to provide comprehensive supply chain finance services, supported by decentralized storage, oracles, and identity verification.

### Core Components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Blockchain-based contracts handling invoices, factoring, credit assessment, and insurance
2. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for storing invoice documentation and supporting evidence
3. **Web Interface**: User-friendly dashboard for all participants
4. **Oracle System**: Integration with traditional banking, ERP systems, and real-world data
5. **Identity Verification**: KYC/AML compliance and business verification system

## Smart Contracts

    - `approveInvoice(invoiceId)`: Buyer confirms invoice validity
    - `splitInvoice(invoiceId, portions)`: Divides invoice for partial financing
    - `settleInvoice(invoiceId, paymentReference)`: Records payment completion
    - `disputeInvoice(invoiceId, reason)`: Initiates resolution process for disputed invoices

### 2. Factoring Contract
Handles invoice factoring, early payment options, and auction mechanisms

    - `releaseEarlyPayment(invoiceId)`: Transfers funds to supplier upon successful factoring
    - `collectFactoringPayment(invoiceId)`: Routes buyer payment to factoring provider at maturity

### 3. Credit Rating Contract
Assesses and maintains creditworthiness scores for network participants
- **Functions**:
    - `generateCreditScore(entityId)`: Calculates initial score based on verified credentials

    - `authorizeAccessToCredit(entityId, requestor)`: Controls privacy of credit information

### 4. Insurance Contract
Provides protection against payment defaults and related supply chain risks
- **Functions**:
    - `underwriteInvoice(invoiceId, coverage, premium)`: Issues insurance policy for specific invoice
    - `calculatePremium(invoiceId)`: Determines insurance cost based on risk factors
    - `fileClaim(invoiceId, evidence)`: Initiates claim process for non-payment
    - `processClaim(claimId, decision)`: Resolves claim and triggers payment if approved
    - `poolRisk(insurancePoolId, contribution)`: Allows risk sharing across multiple insurers
